Welcome! The Apollo community is made up of developers around the world who are building awesome things with GraphQL. Here you can learn how to get help with Apollo and GraphQL, contribute to Apollo projects, and attend events and talks organized by the community.

###Join the Community 

Come chat with Apollo team members, contributors, and developers on [our Slack](http://www.apollostack.com/#slack). It’s a great place to get help using Apollo and discuss the latest in the GraphQL community.

To keep up to date on all things Apollo, you can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/apollostack), [Medium](https://medium.com/apollo-stack), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theapollostack/). 

###Contribute to Apollo

The Apollo project lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/apollostack), and is made up of a diverse set of tools for implementing GraphQL, written and maintained by [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/apollostack/people) around the world. We’d love your help!

Here are some ways you can get involved with the project:

- Report an issue
- Submit a pull request
- Update or write documentation
- Write a blog post
- Give a conference talk
- Organize a meetup

To get started contributing, first read our Code of Conduct and [Contributor Guide](http://dev.apollodata.com/community/contributing.html). If you have any questions along the way, just pop into the **#contributing channel on Slack**. We can’t wait to work with you!
