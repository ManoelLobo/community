It can be hard to find the time to consume a dense, 10-minute read about technical best practices. That's why we launched Apollo Mission Briefing, a video series starring one of Apollo's open source engineers, [Peggy Rayzis](https://twitter.com/peggyrayzis)! She makes topical, bite-sized videos featuring the GraphQL tips and tricks we've heard people asking about most, sometimes including guest appearances from members of the community. 

## Videos
